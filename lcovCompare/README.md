## lcovCompare
This script compares the code coverage output generated by lcov between two runs. 
It is useful if you want to check regression in coverage due to your changes.

For coverage, you need to get the coverage results from gcov(https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/gcov.htm)
and interpret the .gcov files using lcov(https://linux.die.net/man/1/lcov) to generate a coverage report in .info format.

eg: lcov --rc lcov_branch_coverage=1 --rc geninfo_auto_base=1 -t "result" -o example.info -c -d . -i

# Steps for coverage compare 
1. You need to get the coverage .info files using the above steps with and wthout your changes
2. Copy both . info files to a directory and invoke the script as below:

3. python3 coverage_compare.py <Path to directory containing .info files>
			OR
   python3 coverage_compare.py <info file 1> <info file 2>

4. The script will then generate the comparison report which you can redirect to any file/log as well

5. Example results
   Left file: abc.info       Right file: def.info
   <<Branch cov reduced 
   for a.c file
                             >>Warning new file present which is not in left coverage
                             >>Function coverage reduced for b.c file
